<h1><u>2.4 I can describe the features, benefits and limitations
    of different  collaborative technology tools and devices </u></h1>
<p>The benefits of collaborative technology tools are that work gets done faster and can be done
    from anywhere and can be done from several devices that support the collaborative technologies</p>
<p>The limitations of them can be that the internet connection could be bad and the technology that one
   person uses could have some worse qualities like a slow machine or the machine could need updates</p>
<p>I will now demonstrate in a table some collaborative technologies benefits and limitations:</p>
    <div class="tableot"><table style="outline-color:black;outline-width:10px;padding:3px;">
    <tr>
    <th>Tool</th><th>Benefits</th><th>Limitations</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Internet</td><td>Easy to setup and browser</td><td>Can often go down or not work as well</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Desktop computer</td><td>Can use keyboard and mouse equipped for easier use</td><td>May need updates or setting up again if user moves location</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Laptop</td><td>applications are the same as a desktop computer</td><td>May be less RAM and won't run high-end applications for long'</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Mobile devices</td><td>Can use it remotely</td><td>Could be limited to certain applications and functions on them</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
    <td>Headset</td><td>Used for speaking on calls</td><td>Could be bad quality or drivers may need updating to work</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
    <td>Voice over IP</td><td>Free over internet and can be used worldwide</td><td>Could have complications such as bad connection or service being down</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>Social media</td><td>Can be assessed anywhere, on different devices and locations</td><td>May be limited to certain functions and may need to pay more for certain features</td>
    </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>Summary: with some devices they already have headsets built in like mobile or
        tablet devices and some may come with applications already provided, such as Apple with their Facetime
        or Microsoft with Teams; although most are available without access to these devices over the internet.
        Voice over IP has limitations as the technology isn't perfected in a lot of devices such Facebook messenger.
        Social media could also be a distraction for some to use while they use them for work purposes.
