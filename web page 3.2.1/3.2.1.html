        <h1><u>2.1 I can describe the purposes for using collaborative technologies</u></h1>
        <p>
            While doing this course we have actually been doing a lot of work using colaborative technologies
            such as Adobe Connect and Microsoft Teams so I know from that their purpose can be to teach
            people things.
        </p>

            Most companies during the Coronavirus pandemic used Zoom, an online video calling service,
            which helped them do meetings because all the offices closed.
            That was a highly useful tool which a lot of people used, even if it wasn't for work purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another colaborative purpose for people using technology to communicate is emails which is widely
            used by people from businesses to personal use because of its ease and how well it works.

        While Adobe has applications like Adobe Connect, Microsoft has their own called Teams and 
        it has a few more features and is more open for wider audiences. Such as holding meetings or collaborating 
        on a project
        </p>

        Twitter offers private messaging facilities and working through different profiles. A lot 
        of a small project details can be viewed on here including pictures and videos. People may also
        use it for networking and finding new clients.
        </p>
        <p>
        Facebook offers one of the biggest audiences and can also be a networking opportunity, people can
        also use their private messaging applications and the use of video calls and send files, similar to Twitter.
        </p>

           These days people are using packages such as Outlook's package to do their workload at their
            job because it offers everything in one place. Google has a similar package. Because companies
            know their key audiences (and they probably use them themselves) they can make the colaborative technologies
            that appeal to the most.
