<center><h1><underline>4.1 I can describe rules of engagement for using collaborative technologies</underline></h1></center>
<p>From working in a team with a manager and team members such as marketing, finance, a secretary and HR, they all
    play a part in the meetings that take place either in the office or online.<p>
    <p>The Chairperson is in charge of making sure the agenda is kept to and that everyone keeps
    to the netiquette rules. The supervisors are in charge of the employees and making sure
    each of them are doing their job properly. Depending on the workplace, it might only be the
    supervisors in the meeting in the meeting.</p>
    <p>One constraint of collaborative technologies is that if some people are online and some are in
    the room then there might be a delay with the people online and everyone might end up speaking over
    each other.</p>
    <p>Also if one person's computer starts to fail on them then it could be time consuming and the
    meeting could be delayed.</p>
    <p>The rules of netiquette might be a problem if some people who are online don't realise the feel
    for the room, i.e if someone said something wrong/offensive and only the people in the room
    realise the person in the room who is offended and the online people don't, it can become awkward.</p>
    <p>Another problem could be that if the chairperson themselves is online and can't manage the meeting
    properly, their delay might mean they miss something in the room and the meeting could steering in
    the wrong direction or lose track altogether and become unprofessional.</p>
